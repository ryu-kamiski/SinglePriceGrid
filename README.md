## Overview
A rather simple layout which was a tad difficult to do, i.e., for me that is.

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the component depending on their device's screen size
- See a hover state on desktop for the Sign Up call-to-action

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

I learned a bunch of stuff from learning about BEM , i.e. the naming system, also about using CSS Resets which I highly recommend to use as it will make life easier. Check out resources for more info on this.

```css
.main {
  min-height: 100%;
  display: grid;
  grid-template-columns: 22rem;
  box-shadow: 0 5px 10px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.25);
  border-radius: 10px;
}
```
### Continued development

üí† Ohh this part is awesome. I looking forward to learning about JavaScript which am still having trouble with, because I have not started anything on it. üò•
